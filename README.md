- Positioning is the same on removing colours
- Allows users to copy Css to clipboard froma single click
- users can choose circle or ellipse for radial gradient

## Dev Reflection

This project was fun and caused me to learn a lot of new to me CSS and refreshed my knowledge on inline styles in react and next
I could've added more features if I had been more methodical with research and planning as I had started with a scope to broad causing set backs due to lack of understanding
I hope people can enjoy this project
